#Create a program using a for loop to print the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms entered by the user.
n = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

# initialize the first two terms
a, b = 0, 1

# print the first two terms
print(a, b, end=" ")

# loop from 2 to n
for i in range(2, n):
    # calculate the next term
    c = a + b
    # print the next term
    print(c, end=" ")
    # update the values of a and b
    a, b = b, c
